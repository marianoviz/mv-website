    "title": "Statistical Analysis of the Effect on Growth Performance of Incorporating Fish Silage in the Diet of Pigs and Broilers in Galapagos",
    "description": "In this analysis, I explored the effects of dietary supplementation with Fish Silage (FS) on the growth performance of pigs and broilers in the Galapagos Islands. For the broiler trials, I conducted statistical analyses using one-way ANOVA to assess the significance of differences in daily weight gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) between groups fed with varying levels of FS. The results showed that the broilers fed with 12% FS had significantly better growth performance, with higher average daily weight gain and lower FCR, compared to the control group and the group fed with 6% FS. Additionally, Cohen's d was used to quantify effect sizes, and Tukey’s HSD test identified specific pairwise differences between treatments. \n\nThe pig trial, although not statistically analyzed due to the small sample size, provided qualitative insights indicating that FS can be successfully used in pig diets without negatively impacting meat quality. Overall, the analysis demonstrated the practical feasibility and potential benefits of FS supplementation in the Galapagos agricultural sector.",

Overview\nThis report provides an exploratory overview of the results obtained in pig and broiler trials designed to assess the effect of dietary supplementation of Fish Silage (FS) from Galapagos fisheries on local productions. These trials were implemented by Conservation International between the months of January and May 2022 in the canton of Santa Cruz, Galapagos.\nSpecifically, productive aspects were evaluated, comparing a control diet based on commercial feeds with diets containing different proportions of FS. Commercial feed and FS intakes, weight gains, and feed conversion ratios (FCR) were compared to estimate the relative effect of FS supplementation on pig and poultry production. In this way, the trials sought to characterize the practical feasibility and productive virtues of FS supplementation in the context of the Galapagos agricultural sector.\nNote: for a detailed description of the experimental design see Annex 1. A general interpretation of the results and a cost-benefit analysis are provided in Annex 2 and 3.\n\n \n\n2. Data and Methods\nProductive information from the trials was collected by the technical team of Conservation International Ecuador during the period of January to May 2022. The data contains observations of 8 pigs and 96 broilers. For both the pig and broiler trials, an exploratory visualization of the measured traits was performed. This was extended for the broiler trial, testing the results for statistical significance using a significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of 0.05. Differences between groups were described by Cohen’s d effect size. The statistical significance of these differences was explored by means of ANOVA. All analyzes were done in R version 4.2.0 using RStudio version 1.4.1743.\n\n \n\n3. Results\nA. Pigs\nThe trial in pigs was carried out between the months of January and March 2022 on a farm located in the Bellavista parish, Santa Cruz, Galapagos. Eight 45-day-old crossbred pigs were randomly distributed into two dietary treatments: a control diet (T1) and a diet with 8% (dry weight) of FS (T2). It was not possible to form replicates given the low number of animals under evaluation. The assessment period was 80 days, ending with animals of 125 days (about 65 kg body weight on average). The animals remained in facilities according to what was detailed in the experimental design (Annex 1) and the traits evaluated were: feed intake, FS intake, weight gain, and carcass yield. Additionally, a sensory evaluation of pork meat was carried out in the laboratory of the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (ESPOL).\nNo detailed statistical analyses were performed for this trial. The limited number of individuals under study and the intrinsic genetic variations between crossbred animals means that statistically significant results cannot be verified. The results of this trial are qualitative in nature, documenting the use of FS in Galapagos pig production.\n\n \n\n\n \n\na.

Nevertheless, this trial showed that FS can be successfully used in Galapagos pig production as a feed supplement, achieving similar yields to those obtained with available commercial feeds.\n\n \n\nb. Sensory Evaluation of the Meat\nAn organoleptic evaluation of the meat was carried out to assess the presence of fish flavor in the animals fed with FS. Samples from animals fed with and without FS were given to 31 untrained panelists. These samples were clustered into groups of three (two samples belonging to the same dietary treatment and a distinct one belonging to the other) asking the panelists to identify the distinct sample. The evaluation methodology assumes that if there were distinguishable differences between the dietary treatments, the panelists could identify the distinct sample with a frequency greater than 33% (probability of selecting the different sample simply by chance).\n\n \n\nTable 2 Results of the sensory evaluation of pork meat from groups T1 and T2 carried out by the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (ESPOL).\n\n\nShow code\n\nmeat_test <- read_csv( \"meat.csv\") %>% \n  clean_names() %>% \n  na.omit(meat_test) \nmeat_test %>% \n  kable(col.names = c(\"Response type\", \"Total response\", \"Total response (%)\")) %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \"striped\", full_width = FALSE)\n\n\nResponse type\n\n\nTotal response\n\n\nTotal response (%)\n\n\nCorrect\n\n\n14\n\n\n45%\n\n\nIncorrect\n\n\n17\n\n\n55%\n\n\n\n \n\nThe results deviate slightly from those expected due to chance if there were no distinguishable differences between the samples. However, according to Lawless and Heymann (2010), these differences are not enough to establish statistically significant differences. When asked, the panelists said that they had not noticed any unusual flavors in the samples tested.\nB. Broilers\nThe trial in broilers was carried out between the months of April and May 2022 on a farm located in the Santa Rosa parish, Santa Cruz, Galapagos province. Ninety-six, day-old broilers (Cobb 500) of either sex were randomized into three treatment groups with two replicates in each group (16 chicks per replicate). The dietary treatments were a control diet (T1), a diet containing 6% FS (T2), and a diet containing 12% FS (T3). The evaluation period was 46 days. Animals remained in facilities according to what was detailed in the experimental design (Annex 1) and the characteristics evaluated were: feed intake, SF intake, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio (FCR).\n\n \n\na.

Summary Statistics\nFeed intake, daily weight gain, and FCR were compared across the three treatments. The following statistical analyzes focus on daily weight gain and feed conversion; these parameters were effectively measured for each animal. Feed and FS were weighed and supplied to each replicate (16 animals), so a real estimate of individual consumption could not be obtained. This individual consumption is assumed to be a proportional average of the total food supplied.\n\n\nShow code\n\n#Data subsets\ngeneral_selected <- general %>% \n  mutate(mean_ganancia_diaria = rowMeans(select(general, c(ganancia_de_peso_diaria_dia1_8:ganancia_de_peso_diaria_dia44_46)), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(mean_ca = rowMeans(select(general, c(ca_dia1_8:ca_dia44_46)), na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \n  select(c(tratamiento,mean_ganancia_diaria, mean_ca))\n\n#Take out outliers:\ngeneral_selected_1 <- general_selected %>% \n  filter(mean_ganancia_diaria < 114, mean_ca < 2.7)\n\n\n\n# Pull vectors of daily weight gain and FCR for each Treatment\nt1_gd <- general_selected_1 %>% \n  filter(tratamiento == \"T1\") %>% \n  pull(mean_ganancia_diaria)\n\nt1_ca <- general_selected_1 %>% \n  filter(tratamiento == \"T1\") %>% \n  pull(mean_ca)\n\nt2_gd <- general_selected_1 %>% \n  filter(tratamiento == \"T2\") %>% \n  pull(mean_ganancia_diaria)\n\nt2_ca <- general_selected_1 %>% \n  filter(tratamiento == \"T2\") %>% \n  pull(mean_ca)\n\nt3_gd <- general_selected_1 %>% \n  filter(tratamiento == \"T3\") %>% \n  pull(mean_ganancia_diaria)\n\nt3_ca <- general_selected_1 %>% \n  filter(tratamiento == \"T3\") %>% \n  pull(mean_ca)\n\n# Get the means & SDs for each: \nt1_gd_mean <- mean(t1_gd)\nt1_ca_mean <- mean(t1_ca)\nt1_gd_sd <- sd(t1_gd)\nt1_ca_sd <- sd(t1_ca)\n\nt2_gd_mean <- mean(t2_gd)\nt2_ca_mean <- mean(t2_ca)\nt2_gd_sd <- sd(t2_gd)\nt2_ca_sd <- sd(t2_ca)\n\nt3_gd_mean <- mean(t3_gd)\nt3_ca_mean <- mean(t3_ca)\nt3_gd_sd <- sd(t3_gd)\nt3_ca_sd <- sd(t3_ca)\n\n\nThe average daily weight gain per animal for the 46 days of the trial was 76.12 \\(\\pm\\) 7.58 g day-1 (n = 29), 72.47 \\(\\pm\\) 6.62 g day-1 (n = 32), 77.41 \\(\\pm\\) 9.65 g day-1 (n = 32), for diets T1, T2, and T3, respectively; values display the daily mean \\(\\pm\\) 1 standard deviation.\nThe average FCR for the 46 days of the trial was 1.78 \\(\\pm\\) 0.18 g day-1 (n = 29), 1.82 \\(\\pm\\) 0.16 g day-1 (n = 32), 1.63 \\(\\pm\\) 0.2 g day-1 (n = 32), for diets T1, T2, and T3, respectively; values display the mean \\(\\pm\\) 1 standard deviation.

Statistically significant differences\nThe plots below show the distribution of average weight gain and FCR for the three treatments. A one-way ANOVA was then performed to compare the effect of these three dietary treatments on daily weight gain and FCR. Significant differences were explored using a significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of 0.05. The differences between groups were quantified using the effect size (Cohen’s d). If significant differences were demonstrated through the one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD test was used as a post-hoc pairwise test to define between which groups, in particular, these differences were statistically significant.\n\n \n\n\n\nShow code\n\nggplot(data = general_selected_1, aes(x = tratamiento, y = mean_ganancia_diaria)) +\n  geom_beeswarm(aes(color = tratamiento), alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"cyan4\",\"goldenrod2\",\"coral\")) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = NA, width = 0.2, outlier.color = NA) +\n  stat_summary(fun=mean, \n               geom=\"point\", \n               shape=20, \n               size=4, \n               color=\"black\", \n               fill=\"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = \"Average daily weight gain (g)\",\n       x = \"Treatment\",\n       col=\"Treatment\")\n\n\n\nFigure 15.

The absolute difference between T1 and T2 daily weight gain means is 3.65 g day-1 (a 4.91% difference), while between T1 and T3 it is -1.29 g day-1 (a -1.68% difference). These differences are significant; one-way ANOVA: p = 0.04. The effect size between diets T1 and T2 is medium (Cohen’s d = 0.51) and between diets T1 and T3 is negligible (Cohen’s d = -0.15). Applying Tukey’s HSD test to determine if the relationship between the different groups is statistically significant, we saw that there was no statistically significant difference in mean daily weight gains between T1 and T2 (p = 0.19) or between T1 and T3 (p = 0.81). The only significant difference was observed between diets T3 and T2 (p = 0.04).\nMean FCR of diet T1 is lower than T2 and higher than T3; 1.78 \\(\\pm\\) 0.18 g day-1, 1.82 \\(\\pm\\) 0.16 g day-1, and 1.63 \\(\\pm\\) 0.2 g day-1, respectively. The absolute difference between the means of T1 and T2 is -0.04 g day-1 (a -2.08% difference), and between T1 and T3 is 0.15 g day-1 (a 9.26% difference). These differences are significant; one-way ANOVA: p = 10^{-4}. The effect size between diets T1 and T2 is small (Cohen’s d = -0.22), while between diets T1 and T3 is large (Cohen’s d = 0.81). As evidenced by Tukey’s HSD test, the differences in FCR between diets T1 and T3 (p = 0.004) and T2 and T3 (p = 2^{-4}) are statistically significant.\nIn summary, the effects on average daily weight gain of the control diet (T1) compared to the diets with FS (T2 and T3) are not statistically different. The only significant difference in average daily weight gain is seen between the diets T2 and T3, with the average daily weight gain of diet T3 being 6.6% higher than T2.\nThe effect of diets with FS on FCR showed significant differences with respect to the control diet. In particular, the difference between T3 and T1 turned out to be large and statistically significant (Cohen’s d = 0.81; Tukey’s HSD p = 0.004). Overall, T3 delivered the best results: higher average daily weight gain and lower FCR.\n\n \n\n4. Summary\nExploratory data analysis and interpretation of trial results reveal the following findings:\nThe trial with pigs showed that FS can be successfully used in Galapagos pig production as a feed supplement, achieving similar yields to those obtained with available commercial feeds and without imparting an undesirable flavor to the meat.\n\n\nShow code\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/Users/marianoviz/Desktop/R Projects and Stuff/ESM 244 Rstudio Work/mv-website/_posts/2022-07-26-statistical-analysis-of-the-effect-on-growth-performance-of-incorporating-fish-silage-in-the-diet-of-pigs-and-broilers-in-galapagos/pigs.png\")\n\n\n\nPigs trial - Galapagos April 2022 | Credit: Luis García Granda\nThe trial with broilers confirmed what was observed in the trial with pigs and also revealed statistically significant differences between the groups evaluated.

The data, sourced from the FAO, showed an initial exponential increase in fish catch over the first 40 years, followed by a plateau. The logistic growth equation was used to model this relationship, with the carrying capacity (K), growth rate constant (k), and initial population parameter (A) estimated through nonlinear least squares fitting.

    "contents": "\nIntroduction\nIn this report, I explore the variables protein, carbohydrate, fat, and energy content in three different food groups (Beef Products, Pork Products, and Poultry Products) by performing a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and reflecting this information on a biplot. PCA is an ordination method used to visualize patterns in multivariate data that allows to reframe multivariate data in a simplified number of dimensions while retaining as much information as possible. This way, PCA enables us to easily explore the relationship between the variables and identify multivariate patterns and outliers.\nData for this report was taken from the USDA National Nutrient Database (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Biplot of the PCA ordination performed for the variables protein, carbohydrate, fat, and energy content in three different food groups. Orange dots represent observations for Beef Products, blue squares for Pork Products, and green triangles for Poultry Products. Their position reflects the score of each observation based on the principal components (PC1 and PC2). Distance between observations approximate the Euclidean distance and allow assessing similarity in multivariate space and identifying multivariate groups and outliers. Arrows show the loading of variables for each principal component (PC1 and PC2). Their length indicates variance in the principal component direction (PC1 horizontal component and PC2 vertical component); the angle between them shows the variables correlation. Data USDA (2019).\nSummary\nDisplayed PCA biplot describes 80% of variance in the analyzed data (PC1 55% and PC2 25%). The arrows convey information about the examined variables. The small angle separating the variables fat and energy reveals a strong positive correlation between them. In turn, these variables are negatively correlated with protein and not highly correlated with carbohydrates (almost right angle). At the same time, the distribution of observation in the biplot enables recognizing multivariate groups and outliers. Here we can observe a big cluster of multivariate similar observations in the center of the biplot and some outlier observations extending vertically (poultry products) and horizontally (mainly beef and pork products).\nCitation:\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service.

With this test we can compare the means\nof the two groups and know the probability of having obtained sample\nmeans at least this different if they were drawn from populations with\nthe same mean (p-value). The selection of this test is based on the fact\nthat thanks to the histograms and quantile-quantile plots we can see\nthat we satisfy the assumptions about distribution, where carapace\nlengths for green and loggerhead turtles follow a relatively normal\ndistribution (bell-shaped histogram and quantile-quantile plot with an\nalmost linear relationship). In case of not satisfying this assumption,\nwe could use a rank-based alternative (Mann-Whitney U test).\n2-Sample T-Test\n\n\n\nOn average, carapace length of green turtles is slightly greater than\nthat of loggerhead turtles (92.64 \\(\\pm\\) 15.78 and 89.91 \\(\\pm\\) 11.44 cm, respectively; mean \\(\\pm\\) 1 standard deviation).

Introduction\nThis report provides an exploratory analysis of juvenile snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) surveyed in a capture-recapture study conducted in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest from 1999 to 2012 (Kielland et al. 2017).\nSpecifically, this report presents: an exploration of the total number of juvenile snowshoe hares sampled by year in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest (1999-2012); a comparison of weights for juvenile male and female snowshoe hares; finally, an analysis of the relationship between juvenile weight and hind foot length.\n2. Data and analyses\nSnowshoe hare data was collected and made available by Dr. Knut Kielland and colleges at the Bonanza Creek Long Term Ecological Research Station in Alaska. The data contains 3197 observations from capture-recapture studies of snowshoe hares, conducted from 1999 to 2012. Following exploratory data visualization, juvenile male and female snowshoe hares weights were compared by a two-sample t-tests (significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of 0.05) and differences between groups were described by Cohen’s d effect size. Finally, the relationship between juvenile snowshoe hare weight and hind foot length was explored by simple linear regression.\nAll analyses are in R version 4.0.2 using RStudio version 1.3.1056.\n3. Exploratory findings\nA. Annual juvenile snowshoe hare trap counts\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Total number of juvenile snowshoe hare (observed via trap capture) by year.\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics (mean, median, minimum and maximum counts) for annual counts of juvenile snowshoe hare trappings. Data: Kielland et al. (2017).\n\n\nAnnual Mean\n\n\nAnnual Median\n\n\nMaximum Count\n\n\nMinimum Count\n\n\n31.5\n\n\n18.5\n\n\n126\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nJuvenile snowshoe hare (observed via trap capture) were counted by year. The minimum and maximum counts of juvenile hare trappings were 2 and 126 respectively. The mean annual number of juvenile hares trapped was 31.5 with a median annual number of 18.5 (Table 1, Figure 1). There is an overall decline in the annual counts of juvenile snowshoe hare for the period 1999-2012. However, the number of days and traps in the study were not standardized for each year, limiting the utility of this methodology for accurately estimating the juvenile hare population.\nB. Juvenile snowshoe hare weights comparison by sex and site\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Weight (g) for juvenile snowshoe hare by sex and site (Bonanza Black Spruce, Bonanza Mature, and Bonanza Riparian). Gold (female), teal (male) and coral (NA) points indicate individual observations for weight (grams) of juvenile snowshoe hare. Box endpoints indicate the 25th and 75th percentile values. The black line and black point within the box indicate the weights median and mean value respectively. Data: Kielland et al. (2017).\nC. Juvenile hare mean weights comparison by sex\nDistributions of weights (plots not included) for juvenile male and female snowshoe hares were relatively normal and symmetric (bell-shaped histogram and quantile-quantile plot with an almost linear relationship).\nTable 2. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and sample size) for weights (g) of juvenile snowshoe hare trappings by sex. Data: Kielland et al. (2017).\n\n\nSex\n\n\nMean Weight (g)\n\n\nStandard deviation (g)\n\n\nSample Size\n\n\nf\n\n\n855.4\n\n\n292.3\n\n\n197\n\n\nm\n\n\n945.9\n\n\n333.2\n\n\n163\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, juvenile snowshoe hare males weight slightly more than female juvenile snowshoe hares (945.86 \\(\\pm\\) 333.22 and 855.39 \\(\\pm\\) 292.25 g, respectively; mean \\(\\pm\\) 1 standard deviation).\nThe absolute difference in means is 90.47 g (a 10.05% difference).\nThe effect size is small (Cohen’s d = 0.29) and the difference in means is significant (Welch two-sample t-test: t(325.02) = 2.71, p < 0.001).\nD. Relationship between juvenile snowshoe hare weight & hind foot length\nThe relationship between hind foot length (mm) and weight (g) was explored for juvenile snowshoe hares by simple lineal regression. Additional variables as sex or sites were not included in the analysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Relationship between hind foot length (mm) and weight (g) for juvenile snowshoe hares. Points indicate individual juvenile snowshoe hare measurements. Linear model summary: \\(\\beta\\)1 = 9.52 g mm-1, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.3, Pearson’s r = 0.55). An equation of this linear model is also displayed in the plot panel. Data: Kielland et al. (2017).\nThe relationship between hind foot length (mm) and weight (g) for juvenile snowshoe hares appears relatively linear (Figure 3). Simple linear regression showed that hind foot length is not a strong predictor of juvenile snowshoe hares weight (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.3); i.e., only 29.88% of the variance in weight is predictable from the hind foot length. The average slope is \\(\\beta\\) = 9.52 g mm-1; meaning that, on average, we expect weight to increase by 9.52grams for each one millimeter increase in hind foot length. Hind foot length and weight are moderately, and significantly, positively correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.55, p < 0.001).\nDiagnostic plots (not included) reveal normally distributed (with a slight skew to the right) residuals.The heteroscedasticity of residuals shown in these plots is a major concern. Linear regression assumes that all residuals are drawn from a population that has a constant variance of the error (homoscedasticity); heteroscedasticity can decrease the predictive capacity of the linear model by underestimating or overestimating uncertainty.\nSummary\nJuvenile hares data exploration reveals the following findings:\nThere is a decrease in the observations of juvenile snowshoe hares (observed via trap capture) from 1999 to 2012. However, as the number of days and traps in each year of the study were not standardized it is difficult to accurately estimate the real variation in the juvenile hare population.\nJuvenile snowshoe hare males weight, on average, slightly more than female juvenile snowshoe hares. The difference in means is significant but the effect size is small (Cohen’s d = 0.29).\nThe linear regression exploration of the relationship between hind foot length and weight for juvenile snowshoe hares revealed that hind foot length is not a strong predictor of weight (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.3). At the same time, the observed heteroscedasticity of residuals weakens the predictive capacity of this model.\nCitations\nKielland, K., F.S. Chapin, R.W.
